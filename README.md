## STEPS FOLLOWED FOR OPTIMIZATION
1. Removed render blocking Javascript and CSS files from all the pages to make sure that the 
 delays in the critical rendering path and hence the page rendering are eliminated.
2. Moved all the javascript file loading towards the end of the page to speed up page loads.
3. Reduced size of images so they don't need to be scaled down and hence load faster.
4. Minified CSS and Javascript files to reduce size of downloads when pages load.
5. In main.js for pizza.html I added the following optimizations
  5.1 In the updatePositions function I moved the querying for scrolling position through scrollTop
      outside the loop which was impacting the Frame rate significantly since the DOM would be queried 
      multiple times.
  5.2 Made a similar optimization in "changePizzaSizes" where the DOM was being queried in a loop
      to determine the offsetWidth. Also saved the query for "randomPizzaContainer" in a variable.
  5.3 Based on the suggestion from my reviewer I also changed the calculation of number of pizzas to be dynamic.
      5.3.1 I calculate the number of columns from the screen resolution and also number of rows of pizza from the 
            screen height. I use the two values to calculate the "totalPizzas" value instead of defaulting it to
            200 pizzas. This speeds up the initial page load since we don't create 200 pizzas everytime.
6. Added the bootstrap "img-responsive" class to project-2048 and project-mobile files to make images responsive on 
   mobile devices.
7. Removed all the "querySelector" instances with "getElementById" and "getElementByClassName"
8. Made other smaller optimizations for getting length of array and variable declarations.

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
